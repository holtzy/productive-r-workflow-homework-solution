## A few consideration about this doc

This Quarto document serves as a practical illustration of the concepts covered in the productive workflow online course. It's designed primarily for _educational purposes_, so the focus is on demonstrating Quarto techniques rather than on the rigor of its scientific content.

## Introduction

This document offers a straightforward analysis of the well-known penguin dataset. It is designed to complement the [Productive R Workflow](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com) online course.

You can read more about the penguin dataset [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

Let's load libraries before we start!

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)    # ipsum theme for ggplot2 charts
library(patchwork)     # combine charts together
library(DT)            # interactive tables
library(knitr)         # static table with the kable() function
library(plotly)        # interactive graphs
```





## Loading data

The dataset has already been loaded and cleaned in the previous step of this pipeline.

Let's load the clean version, together with a few functions available in `functions.R`.

```{r}
# Source functions
source(file="functions.R")

# Read the clean dataset
data <- readRDS(file = "../input/clean_data.rds")
```

Note that `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` have the following signification.

![Bill measurement explanation](asset/culmen_depth.png){width=300}

In case you're wondering how the original dataset looks like, here is a searchable version of it, made using the `DT` package:

```{r}
datatable(data, options = list(pageLength = 5), filter = "top")
```




## Bill Length and Bill Depth

Now, let's make some descriptive analysis, including <b>summary statistics</b> and <b>graphs</b>.

What's striking is the <b>slightly negative relationship</b> between `bill length` and `bill depth`. One could definitely expect the opposite.

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width=5, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between bill <b>length</b> and bill <b>depth</b>. <b>All</b> data points included."}
p <- data %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)
  ) +
    geom_point(color="#69b3a2") +
    labs(
      x = "Bill Length (mm)",
      y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
      title = paste("Surprising relationship?")
    ) + 
  theme_ipsum()
ggplotly(p)
```



It is also interesting to note that `bill length` a and `bill depth` are quite different from one specie to another. The average of a variable can be computed as follow:

$${\displaystyle Avg={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}={\frac {a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}}{n}}}$$

`bill length` and `bill depth` averages are summarized in the 2 tables below.

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2

bill_length_per_specie <- data %>%
 group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(average_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

kable(bill_length_per_specie)

bill_depth_per_specie <- data %>%
 group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

kable(bill_depth_per_specie)

bill_length_adelie <- bill_length_per_specie %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  pull(average_bill_length) %>%
  round(2)
```
For instance, the average bill length for the specie `Adelie` is `r bill_length_adelie`.

Now, let's check the relationship between bill depth and bill length for the specie `Adelie` on the island `Torgersen`:

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, fig.cap="There is actually a positive correlation when split by species."}

# Use the function in functions.R
p1 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Adelie", "#6689c6")
p2 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Chinstrap", "#e85252")
p3 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Gentoo", "#9a6fb0")

p1 + p2 + p3
```
