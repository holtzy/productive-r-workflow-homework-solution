## Introduction

We'll explain what our work is about here.

Let's load libraries first

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```


## Loading data

The dataset has already been loaded and cleaned in the previous step of this pipeline.

Let's load the clean version, together with a few functions available in functions.R.

```{r}
# Source functions
source(file="functions.R")

# Read the clean dataset
data <- readRDS(file = "../input/clean_data.rds")
```

## Bill length

```{r}
# Summary
summary(data)

# Calculating mean bill length for different species and islands using dplyr
data %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_length = round(mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 2))

# Use the function in functions.R
create_scatterplot(data, "Adelie", "Torgersen")

```
