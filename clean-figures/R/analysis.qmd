## Introduction

This document offers a straightforward analysis of the well-known penguin dataset. It is designed to complement the [Productive R Workflow](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com) online course.

You can read more about the penguin dataset [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

Let's load libraries before we start!

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)    # ipsum theme for ggplot2 charts
library(patchwork)     # combine charts together
```





## Loading data

The dataset has already been loaded and cleaned in the previous step of this pipeline.

Let's load the clean version, together with a few functions available in `functions.R`.

```{r}
# Source functions
source(file="functions.R")

# Read the clean dataset
data <- readRDS(file = "../input/clean_data.rds")
```


![Bill measurement](asset/culmen_depth.png){width=3in}



## Bill Length and Bill Depth

Now, let's make some descriptive analysis, including <b>summary statistics</b> and <b>graphs</b>.

What's striking is the <b>slightly negative relationship</b> between `bill length` and `bill depth`:

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width=5, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between bill <b>length</b> and bill <b>depth</b>. <b>All</b> data points included."}
data %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)
  ) +
    geom_point(color="#69b3a2") +
    labs(
      x = "Bill Length (mm)",
      y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
      title = paste("Surprising relationship?")
    ) + 
  theme_ipsum()
```

It is also interesting to note that `bill length` a and `bill depth` are quite different from one specie to another. This is summarized in the 2 tables below:

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2

data %>%
 group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(average_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

data %>%
 group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

This canNow, let's check the relationship between bill depth and bill length for the specie `Adelie` on the island `Torgersen`:

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, fig.cap="There is actually a positive correlation when split by species."}

# Use the function in functions.R
p1 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Adelie", "#6689c6")
p2 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Chinstrap", "#e85252")
p3 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Gentoo", "#9a6fb0")

p1 + p2 + p3
```
