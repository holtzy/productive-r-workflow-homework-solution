<p>Relationship between bill <b>length</b> and bill <b>depth</b>. <b>All</b> data points included.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is also interesting to note that <code>bill length</code> a and <code>bill depth</code> are quite different from one specie to another. The average of a variable can be computed as follow:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\displaystyle Avg={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}={\frac {a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}}{n}}}\]</span></p>
<p><code>bill length</code> and <code>bill depth</code> averages are summarized in the 2 tables below.</p>
